<h1>Open-source LED Poi Operating System</h1>

<p>The aim of this project is to create an open-source framework for LED Poi that can
be used to create a variety of Poi from simple colour-changing effects to advanced 
customisable LED pixel poi.</p>

<h1>Goals</h1>

<p>The poi will be easy and cheap to make. 
They will be made using easily sourced materials and require no expensive tools 
to produce. The electronics will use open platforms like Arduino or Digispark.</p>

<p>The software will be open-source and hackable. Available via <a href="https://github.com/PoiOS">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>The colours and patterns should be easy to customise for non-technical users.</p>

<h1>Get involved</h1>

<p>Drop me a line if you're interested in helping to make this project awesome.
That might be help with electronics, or tips for constructing the poi hardware,
helping code the GUI pattern designer or the OS, 
or mad poi skills and want to test out and offer design advice.
